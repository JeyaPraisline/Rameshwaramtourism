            <h2>Ramanathaswamy Temple - Rameswaram</h2><br>
            <p>Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram is considered to be an important and one of the foremost pilgrimage sites to visit for the followers of Hinduism. It is strongly believed and followed that a visit to this temple will wash away one's sins and bring salvation. Located on an island off the Sethu coast, Ramanathaswamy temple can be reached via Pamban bridge across the sea. This temple is closely linked with the great epic Ramayana. All the legends in unison mention that it was lord Rama, who installed this Lord Shiva’s idol (Lingam) here. Story holds that when lord Rama was on his way to Sri Lanka to bring back his abducted wife by demon king Ravana, he reached this place where he made a linga of sand and worshipped it. Rama got the blessings from Shiva and he also requested Lord Shiva to reside eternally here so that the entire mankind should benefit from him. This is how the Lingam developed.
               According to yet another legend, while returning to Ayodhya, Rama worshipped Lord Shiva in the form of a Shiva Lingam with his wife Sita. It is said that Hanuman (monkey God) was entrusted with the task of bringing an image of lord Shiva from Varanasi. Since it took more time than scheduled for Hanuman’s return, Rama offered worship to a Shivalingam at a pre-chosen auspicious moment. It is said that the names Ramalingam and the town Rameswaram were thus obtained. The temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, the construction of the temple was believed to be around the 17th century. 
               <br><br>At the beginning, the temple was just a thatched shed under the cover of a Sage and the present structure was the work of a number of people spread over a number of centuries but the pride of the place goes to the Sethupathi rulers of Ramanathapuram. In the 12th century, Parakramabahu, King of Sri Lanka constructed the Sanctum Sanctorum. In the 16th century, Tirumalai Sethupathi built a portion of the second corridor. 
               His statue and that of his son Raghunatha Sethupathi are found by the side of the Southern entrance to the Ambal shrine. Udayan Sethupathi of Ramanathapuram and a Vaisya of Nagoor built the western stone tower of 78 feet high and the compound wall late in the 17th century. Early in the 18th century, Ravi Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi built the Palliyarai and the Mandapam in front of the Ambal temple. At the same time, the World famous III corridor was constructed by Muthuramalinga Sethupathi. 
               His statue and those of his two ministers are found in the Western entrance in that corridor. 
               A Pilgrimage to Rameswaram is among the important injunctions laid on the Hindu from time immemorial.

            <h2>Pamban Bridge (Road bridge and Railway bridge) - Rameswaram</h2><br>
            <p>The Pamban Bridge (Road bridge and Railway bridge) stands as a massive structure over the Indian Ocean, parallel to each other between the shores of Mandapam and Pamban, the starting point of Rameswaram island. However, the name ‘Pamban bridge’ refers to both of them, it is actually the name of the Pamban Railway Bridge. It is an engineering marvel that evokes awe. Standing with 143 piers, spanning 2 km between the mainland and the island, it is one of the longest sea bridges in India. The idea of construction of a bridge between these places was planned as early as the 1870s by the British. They wanted to have a trade link with India and Sri Lanka. The construction began in 1911. In the year 1964, the bridge survived a major cyclone that flattened Dhanushkodi, a port town at the tip of Rameswaram island. The stone and concrete metals used for the bridge were brought by rail from a quarry which was situated 250 km away from Pamban. 
               <br><br>It was mentioned that nearly 4000 tons of cement, 136000 cubic feet of clay, 18000 cubic feet of crushed metal, 163000 cubic feet of sand and 80000 cubic feet of boulders were used for the construction of this rail bridge. The bridge is also called a cantilever Scherzer rolling lift bridge, named after the German engineer ‘Scherzer’, who built the viaduct. The Scherzer roll and lift pan is a manual operation, work by principle of spurs and gears to gain enormous mechanical advantage. For the passage of the vessels in the sea, the bridge is lifted. The Port officer has to inform the bridge operator the time taken of crossing of the steamer. The bridge operator informs the station master & the controller before he lifts the bridge. The entire operation lasts for nearly 40 minutes. Now, the Indian Government has already begun the construction of the similar bridge with advance facilities easing the operation.

            <h2>Dhanushkodi - Southeastern tip of Rameswaram Island</h2><br>
            <p>Dhanushkodi is a deserted town at the southeastern tip of the Rameswaram island. The word Dhanushkodi literally means ‘tip of the bow’ (of Lord Rama), in connection with the epic Ramayana. The town lost its charm by a destructive cyclone, happened in the year 1964 leaving this place uninhabited in the aftermath. The boulders found linking the island with Sri Lanka were believed to be built by lord Rama. This place is known as Adam's bridge or Ram Sethu. Idols of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman and Vibhishana can be found here. The Government declared the town as Ghost town and unfit for living after the storm. It is advisable to go during day time to the village and return to the town before sunset as the entire 15 km stretch is quite lonely.
               <br><br>
               One can find equal experience as a beach and isolated town. The beach is a vast stretch of silvery sand with crystal clear water making coral reefs easily visible. It is one of the perfect places to spend some serene moments. The ambience and atmosphere make anyone stay longer. Sea surfing is also done on this beach. In addition, the amazing view of sunrise is highly enjoyed. As the beach is almost abandoned, tourists can delight in a silent walk, far from the hustle and bustle of busy beaches. However, the term ‘haunted’ doesn’t signify about some supernatural existence here but also about its dejected beauty that cannot be overlooked.

            <h2>Devipattinam Navapashanam Temple - 9 Planets Temple</h2><br>
          <p>Devipattinam is a coastal located 70 km from Rameswaram. The legend is associated with the epic Ramayana. Before undertaking the journey to bring back Sita from Lanka, lord Rama was said to have performed prayers towards Navagraha (9 planets) in this place, installing all the deities on his own hands. Since the temple is located close to the shore, one may get to see all or few of them, depending on the water levels. The practise of offering nine different types of grains specific to each of the nine planets is common mode of worship. Unlike other south Indian temples where people are not allowed to touch the main deities, pilgrims can get into the deities. According to Hinduism astrology, the life of a human depends upon the conduct and positions of nine planets. The outcomes of these placements are subjected to rejoice or sufferings based on their deeds in the previous birth. Therefore, devotees come here to worship these planets for a better life.

            <h2>Aadhi Jagannatha Perumal Temple - Thirupullani | Vishnu Temple</h2><br>
             <p>Located at a distance of around 60 km from Rameshwaram, the Aadhi Jagannatha Perumal Temple at Thirupullani, is one of the 108 Divya Desam temples, revered by vaishnavite saints. The Presiding deity here is lord Vishnu in the name of Adhi Jagannatha Perumal. There is a pipal tree behind the sanctum, wherein we can find hundreds of serpents stones. This temple not only attracts visitors with strong mythology but also for its architectural brilliance. Built during the reign of Cholas, various contributions were made to this temple by the successive Pandyan and Sethupathy kings. The mythology says that Lord Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, is said to have performed penance towards Lord Samudra Raja (Ocean God) to solicit a way to reach Sri Lanka to bring back his wife Sita. It is also told that Dasaratha (father of lord Rama) had made many sacrifices to acquire the holy payasam (Sweet Pudding) to enhance the fertility of his 3 wives. This is the reason behind for the devotees, who are childless, worship at this temple by offering sweet pudding to the lord. They install an image of a snake God in the temple as a part of this worship and this process is called ‘Nagaprathishta’. Historians believe that some portions of the temple tower might also have been built by Jaffna kings, who had trade relations with the rulers of the region. The temple can be added in the list on the way to Rameswaram. The temple is now maintained by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of Tamil Nadu Government.

            <h2>Mangalanatha Swamy Temple - Uthirakosamangai</h2><br>
            <p>This temple is located in Uthirakosamangai village, 15 km away from Ramanathapuram. The presiding deity here is Lord Shiva in the name of Mangalanatha Swamy and his consort Parvati as Mangalambigai. The construction of the temple was assumed to be initiated by the Pandya kings Achutappa Nayak, Muthuveerappan and other kings of Ramanthapuram at that time. The temple has its mention in the hymns of 9th-century saint Manickavasagar and 15th-century saint Arunagirinathar. The temple is believed to exist since 3000 years ago. This is the place where Lord Shiva transferred the taught Vedas to his consort Goddess Parvati. Thus the name Uthirakosamangai came to use (Uthiram - secrets, kosam - to say, mangai - girl).
               It is believed that problems related to the previous birth, astrology, delayed marriage etc will be solved if one visits here. Another significant fact about this temple is that the Nataraja idol here. At a height of almost 6 feet, It is made up of the most precious and rare emerald. We can not find such a huge emerald idol anywhere in the world. It is scientifically believed that emeralds are more sensitive and can’t withstand sunlight and water. So, the statue here is enveloped by sandal paste all the time. Once in a year, the devotees get the opportunity to witness this idol without sandal, which is colloquially called ‘Arudra Darisanam’. People from the neighbourhood throng on this day, which comes every year in January month. Further to these historical significances, the temple is highly noted for its dravidian architecture also.
